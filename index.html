        Almost all of the critical information regarding monsters can be found 
        in the applet above, and I am writing this as a reflection as to "why" 
        I made it rather than "what" is in it. I will keep this relatively informal, 
        as this is the most effective way to convey my entire thought process as 
        succinctly as possible.

    <p class="info">
        Learning about a new topic is overwhelming. There is an obscene amount 
        of information to consume at once; typically, new learners can never get 
        past this overwhelming feeling. This leads to a plethora of people who
         would otherwise be interested and engaged with the topic but end up 
         abandoning it simply because their first exposure was poor. To lower 
         this "barrier to entry," presented information must be (1) short, 
         (2) comprehensive, and (3) engaging. These three aspects are 
         absolutely essential to get a newcomer interested in learning more. 
    </p>

    <p class="info">
        By creating a three-dimensional visual, I've inherently made an enticing 
        demonstration, encouraging new learners to explore the space further and 
        learn more about monsters. This information could be easily presented on 
        a flat, appropriately titled, and bulleted document, but it's roughly 
        five pages of content, and engaging it in any other way besides reading 
        the entire two thousand words is impossible. Instead, I approach engagement 
        through music, allowing learners to visualize, listen, and read the 
        presented content. The three-dimensional spectrograms on-screen accompany 
        the music, creating explicit ways for learners to "explore" the space, 
        thus learning more about monsters. I've manually separated all the 
        information into three categories: monster, song, and interpretation. 
        This directly limits the information that reaches the learner, allowing 
        them to pick and choose what they read and when they read it. By 
        providing this ability to focus on specific sections of the presentation, 
        there is inherently more control handed to the learner, making the project 
        even more effective and engaging.
    </p>

    <p class="info">
        Everything in this applet was done with a distinct purpose, aiming to 
        introduce a positive learning experience that encourages learners to 
        explore and expand their knowledge on their own time.

    <p class="info">
        I'll say a little bit about the "what" is contained in here and how I 
        organized the information into meaningful chunks—most of my analysis 
        of the monsters in each of the songs comes from Cohen's theses 
        (as discussed in class). Cohen speaks about specific attributes that 
        constitute a monster, such as desire, liminality, hybridity, and 
        projection, and these appear constantly and are extremely apparent 
        throughout all mentions of monsters. I detail this in a few songs, 
        highlighting specific lyrics that support one of these defining traits. 
        I also go beyond these traits and explore some intriguing attributes 
        about monsters that these songs uncover through their metaphors and 
        implications (specifically, an exciting connection between fear and 
        fascination). I vary my approach to an interpretation to offer 
        holistically engaging material and a more well-rounded perspective on 
        the general topic of monsters.

        NOTE: I left Monster Mash in there for fun since it is a classic monster 
        song, but I didn't go into an in-depth analysis since it uncovers some 
        existing themes I've already explored. It felt wrong to take it out of 
        the project altogether, so I moved it back out of the way.
